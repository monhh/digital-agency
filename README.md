From Figma to Web:

With native CSS3, using the & symbol for nesting, kebab-case and alphabetical order for structure and properties. 

With pure html5 first and then using hard-coded and dynamically-coded data, using the Fetch API, with the json-server dependency: https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server.

Make the database creating a *.json file.

Run:
npm init -y (for create package.json)
npm i json-server (for install dependency)
npx json-server data/data.json (run the server:)
